# ðŸ§  Software Design Agent â€“ Summary

The **Software Design Agent** is an AI-powered assistant that helps **software architects and developers** build architecture and detailed design for **embedded and POSIX-based systems** in safety-critical industries like **automotive, aerospace, medical**, and **defense**.

## âœ… What It Does

### 1. Understands Requirements
- Accepts **natural language**, templates, and **code snippets** as input.
- Extracts functional and non-functional requirements using large language models (LLMs).

### 2. Generates Architecture & Design
- Produces **UML and SysML diagrams** (e.g., system context, component, sequence diagrams).
- Suggests system structures, communication flows, and deployment models.
- Outputs are compatible with tools like **PlantUML** and **Draw.io**.

### 3. Validates Against Standards
- Ensures compliance with **ISO 26262**, **ISO 21434**, **ASPICE**, **DO-178C**, and others.
- Applies **design rule checks** and static validations for safety and security.

### 4. Iterative Design Assistant
- Enables back-and-forth design refinement.
- Tracks requirement-to-design traceability.
- Provides **rationale** for design choices.

### 5. Flexible Deployment
- Works as a **standalone tool**, **plugin/extension**, or **cloud service**.
- Integrates with **version control systems**, **IDEs**, and **CI/CD** pipelines.
